# SIGCOMM 2021 Tutorial: 5G-Connected Edge Cloud

### The Next-Gen SDN tutorial!

This tutorial is targeted at students and practitioners who want to learn about the building blocks of the next-generation SDN (NG-SDN) architecture, such as:
* Data plane programming and control via P4 and P4Runtime
* Configuration via YANG, OpenConfig, and gNMI
* Stratum switch OS
* ONOS SDN controller

### Introduction

Tutorial sessions are organized around a sequence of hands-on exercises that show how to build a leaf-spine data center fabric based on IPv6, using P4, Stratum, and ONOS. Exercises assume an intermediate knowledge of the P4 language, and a basic knowledge of Java and Python. Participants will be provided with a starter P4 program and ONOS app implementation. Exercises will focus on concepts such as:
* Using Stratum APIs (P4Runtime, gNMI, OpenConfig, gNOI)
* Using ONOS with devices programmed with arbitrary P4 programs
* Writing ONOS applications to provide the control plane logic (bridging, routing, ECMP, etc.)
* Testing using bmv2 in Mininet
* PTF-based P4 unit tests
